Opened in March 2001 in the Osaka Bay Area, the theme park occupies an area of 39 hectares and is the most visited amusement park in Japan after Tokyo Disney Resort.

Universal Studios Japan currently has eight sections: Hollywood, New York, San Francisco, Jurassic Park, Waterworld, Amity Village, Universal Wonderland and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

Once we arrived at USJ, we discovered it is similar to Disney Sea in terms of crowd – there were lots of people and it was quite hard moving around. I already guessed by now the waiting queue for the popular attractions will stretch up to 3-4 hours so our chances of going on a good ride are very slim.

We headed to the Harry Potter ticketing area to reserve our entrance slot – the attraction is so popular you can’t just walk in. We managed to secure a slot for 1:40pm.
