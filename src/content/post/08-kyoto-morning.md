When we finally reached Shin Osaka, there was a few minutes wait for the next train but it was worth it as the journey only takes a few minutes (compared to the local train which can take an hour). We chanced it and didn’t reserve any seats and it was okay.

At Kyoto station we discovered there are huge queues for most of the buses. Fortunately there was a bus every 10 minutes so we did not have to wait long.

We took a bus to see Ginkakuji (Silver Pavilion). Along the way, we had some delicious pink Choux Pastry (sakura flavour).
