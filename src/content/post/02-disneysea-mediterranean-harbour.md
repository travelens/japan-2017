DisneySea is quite different from the other Disney theme parks we have visited. The entrance leads us to a mock set of Italian looking buildings facing a harbour. Overall the look was a cross between Venice and Florence with even a replica of the Ponte Vecchio.

Mediterranean Harbor (American spelling) is the entrance “port-of-call” and themed as an Italian port city, with Venetian Gondolas that guests can board and ride.

For the popular attractions and shows, there is a Fast Track system similar to Disneyland Hong Kong where you can register for a specific time to bypass the queue. We tried registering for one attraction and was dismayed to discover the earliest time it gave us was 8:30 pm.

Then we saw people were queueing up 2 hours in advance for a show. The waiting time for popular attractions ranged from 2-4 hours! Holy LEGO Batman!

We ended up choosing all the attractions that didn’t have a long waiting time. This includes riding on a themed classic car, riding the train, the boat, plus the Sinbad version of the Its A Small World boat ride in Disneyland. We did queue for over an hour for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, which turned out to be disappointing (it was very dark and I could hardly see anything).

The next few posts are of us visiting the various “ports of call” located around DisneySea, each with a different “theme” representing a (real or imaginary) nautical location in the world.
