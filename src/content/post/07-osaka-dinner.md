We didn’t get back to Osaka station till quite late. We tried a pasta place called Roma because I was hankering for a decent Italian but these place served a distinctively Japanese take on pasta.

I tried the curry Neapolitan – and the spaghetti were actually udon noodles, plus a tomato based sauce with prawns and chop sum. On top is a layer of mushroom curry sauce.

After dinner we got lost again in the twisty underground tunnels and ended up at Yodobashi again. I noticed a shop selling spam sushi. When we finally made it back to the hotel were we’re glad to see our luggage has finally arrived but we did not have much time to enjoy them, as we have to repack and exchange our used clothes with clean ones so that we can forward our luggage to Tokyo that very night (to ensure it arrives on time).
