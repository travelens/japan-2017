We then walked back to Tokyo Station. We were both hungry by then and decided to find some place to eat. We were told the Kitchen Street in Tokyo Station had reasonably priced food, but we were still surprised that prices were generally higher than Osaka. We found a nice donburi place and I tried the yakitori don. It was quite nice, but I didn’t like the sweetmeats and left the dish unfinished.

After that, we wandered in search of Character Street, where there is a row of shops selling toys based on various character themes. We found the Hello Kitty shop, as well as the Rilakkuma shop, but there was also Donguri Republic selling Studio Ghibli merchandise. Of course, Pokemon was there but I am sad to report I don’t recognise many of the characters in some of the shops. I particularly liked the Tomy Car shop and we bought some gifts there.

We then headed to the hotel. Today was supposed to be a nice easy relaxing day, but I was surprised that Apple Watch told me I had walked over 20,000 steps yet again.
