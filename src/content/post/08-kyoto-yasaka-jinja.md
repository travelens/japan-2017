After that we went to yet another temple (Anraku-ji) but it was closed. The fourth temple (Reikan-ji) was open but charging an admission fee. Since we were running out of time, we decided to skip this temple, and take a bus further down to see the Chion-in temple. The bus stopped outside the Yasaka-jinja shrine.

There are some bright red coloured gates on the outside, where there were also tons of street food stalls. Some of the stalls served very interesting food – unfortunately we were too full to sample any of them.

The shrine includes several buildings, including gates, a main hall and a stage.
