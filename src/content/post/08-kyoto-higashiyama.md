We didn’t have much time to explore Chion-in, so reluctantly we left and started to walk towards Kiyomizu-dera (one of the top 3 Kyoto temples in terms of popularity). The path takes us through the stone-paved roads in Higashiyama (Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka).

This area around the stone-paved roads Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka that lead up to the World Heritage Kiyomizu Temple, enjoy protected status to preserve the traditional style buildings.

On the way, we passed through Kodai-ji temple and lots and lots of shops. One of them was a cafe specialising in Hello Kitty themed food, and another sold Hello Kitty kimonos/yukatas.
