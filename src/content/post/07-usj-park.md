The tradition of dressing up in similar outfits visiting a theme park is present in USJ and Osakans tend to wear bolder and brighter colours than their Tokyo counterparts. Lots of people were wearing Minion yellow outfits but also various people in Harry Potter inspired outfits.

We weren’t wearing a theme, but lots of people assumed we were because of our pink North Face rain jackets. I was even complimented on my pink outfit on several occasions – I wonder if they realise this is my normal wear and not a special outfit for USJ. Lots of people also noticed my pink Hello Kitty decorated Sony camera.

Elmo had various mini rides, but most of them were too small for me so I didn’t try. Even so, the waiting times for them were at least 30 mins.

After leaving Wonderland, we did a quick tour of the theme park, which is very American flavoured. There is a recreation of New York complete with the Guggenheim, plus San Francisco complete with Fisherman’s Wharf. In addition, there are specially themed Spider-Man, Jurassic Park and Jaws (Amity Island) areas. There is even a Neon Genesis Evangelion ride in the Japan Cool section.
