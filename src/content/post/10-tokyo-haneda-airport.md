We arrived at Haneda airport, and wandered around the airport shopping area until it was time to check in. There were quite a lot of shops in Levels 4 and 5 of the airport, including a Hello Kitty shop with a very cute Hello Kitty vending machine.

Tokyo International Airport (東京国際空港), commonly known as Haneda Airport (羽田空港), Tokyo Haneda Airport, and Haneda International Airport (IATA: HND, ICAO: RJTT), is one of the two primary airports that serve the Greater Tokyo Area. The official website has an English section. In 2020, Skytrax rated Haneda as the 2nd Best Airport after Singapore’s Changi Airport, and is the World’s Cleanest and Best Domestic Airport.
