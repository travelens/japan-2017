The Ginkaku-Ji is also the start of the Philosopher’s Path – a beautiful walk along the canal that covers quite a few temples. We went to the next temple on the path – Honen-in. There were almost nobody at this temple which is great, plus it was free entry. This is a nice quiet reflective temple and nominated on Inside Kyoto as the top temple out of over 2000. There is an amazing statue of Buddha here, and the overall feel is quite calming, with a set of buildings arranged around a courtyard and a small pond.
