Canon has 3 camera showrooms and service centres in Japan. This is the one in Osaka, located in Umeda near Herbis Plaza in 2017 (it has since moved to the Nakanoshima Festival Tower).

Canon used to have many more service centres all over Japan (including one in Shinjuku which I visited in 2008) but sadly most of them have closed in recent years. This is one of 3 remaining, where you can get your camera serviced, browse cameras and printers, and play around with camera bodies and lenses.
