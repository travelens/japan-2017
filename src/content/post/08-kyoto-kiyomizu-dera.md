Kiyomizu-dera (清水寺), formally Otowa-san Kiyomizu-dera (音羽山清水寺), is a Buddhist temple in eastern Kyoto.
Kiyomizu-dera is part of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto and a UNESCO World Heritage site.

The final leg of the walk towards Kiyomizu-dera is an ascent up a narrow path absolutely filled with shops and people. We have completely underestimated how popular this temple is and it was almost impossible to make a decent walking pace with the crowd of people.

When we finally reached the temple, we discovered it was under reconstruction. Because of that, we didn’t want to pay the entrance fee, so we just took pictures around the outside and skipped the main hall.
