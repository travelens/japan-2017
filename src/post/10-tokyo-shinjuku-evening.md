We spend the rest of evening walking back from the Tokyo Metropolitan Goverment building along the subways and streets of Shinjuku.

Incidentally, all throughout our trip we have experienced great weather, although a bit chilly. We remember on our trip 9 years ago, it rained pretty much every other day, so we have been incredibly fortunate that it has not rained significantly until now (it did rain the morning we left Hiroshima, but it cleared by the time arrived in Fukushima).

By the time we came back to the hotel in the late afternoon, it had settled into a constant drizzle. We repacked all our luggage and waited for the airport limousine bus to take us to Haneda. By the time the bus left Shinjuku, the drizzle has progressed into solid rain. It was almost as if Tokyo was sad to see us leave and was crying!
