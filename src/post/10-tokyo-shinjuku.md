After the park, we headed back to Shinjuku Station looking for a place to eat. We discovered a whole building (MyLord) dedicated to cafes and restaurants, and on the 7th floor we discovered a cafe selling Singapore chicken rice. I ordered the fried chicken version, and it was surprisingly yummy, and the price was quite reasonable too.
