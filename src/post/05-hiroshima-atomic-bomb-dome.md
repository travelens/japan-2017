The Hiroshima Peace Memorial (広島平和記念碑), commonly called the Genbaku or Atomic Bomb Dome (原爆ドーム), is part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.

The Genbaku Dome (aka Hiroshima Peace Memorial, or the Atomic Bomb Dome) is a former exhibition hall. The building is located very close to the hypocentre of the atomic blast.

The popular mythology is that this is the only building that survived the blast. I discovered this is not so. A sign at the tourist information centre (Rest House) in the Peace Park proclaimed it also survived nearly intact.

Officially part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and park, the [website](http://hpmmuseum.jp/?lang=eng) has an English section.

However the shell of the building is still a powerful reminder of what happened one fateful day. The Genbaku Dome stands almost exactly as it did after the bombing on 6 August 1945. Changes to the ruins, meant to ensure the stability of the structure, have been minimal.

The building was formerly the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall (広島県産業奨励館). The distinctive dome was a prominent feature. It was used for various arts and educational exhibitions.

Its survival may have been because it was almost right underneath the blast. There was a lot of downward pressure, but not a lot of sideward pressure to blow the building away. The building was also earthquake resistant, which may have also helped.

The Genbaku Dome is part of the [UNESCO World Heritage List](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/775) based on:

- its survival from a destructive force (atomic bomb),
- the first use of nuclear weapons on a human population,
- and its representation as a symbol of peace.

To my surprise, both the United States of America and China had objected to its inclusion in the UNESCO list.

The Genbaku Dome has an eerie beauty about it. I enjoyed taking photographs from various angles.
