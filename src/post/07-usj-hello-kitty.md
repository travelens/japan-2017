> A superbly fashionable zone enchanting all females – from young girls to mature women.

(Men obviously need not bother)

The key attraction for Hello Kitty is the ribbon gallery, which showcase various clothing designs, shoes and handbags featuring Hello Kitty and the red ribbon motif. Plus a photo shoot with Hello Kitty herself! There was also a cupcake ride that wasn’t very overtly Hello Kitty but very pink.
