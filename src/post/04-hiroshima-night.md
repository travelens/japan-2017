We got back to Hiroshima at night. We tried to find a good okonomiyaki place. However, by the time we found one it was crowded with a queue of people waiting to get in. So we opted for Plan B and went to a Chinese restaurant. I had a simple fried rice and some shiu mai. Luckily, our bags arrived by the time we checked in. I was so tired I fell asleep almost immediately after my bath.
