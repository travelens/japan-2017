Fukuyama (福山市) is a city located on the Ashida River in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan.

On the way back to Fukuyama I saw some evidence of Japan&#8217;s recession &#8211; closed shops on a Monday. Near the station. There is a rose trellis in honour of Hugh Jackman &#8211; I took a picture there.

At the station, we bought some inari and some momiji cakes (which are famous in this region) for lunch. The momiji was delicious &#8211; maple syrup flavoured &#8211; and go down well with coffee or tea.
