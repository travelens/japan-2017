A week worth of 20000 step days has taken a toll on us &#8211; found it very hard to get up at 5am (my usual wake up time) and ended up waking at 6:30. We had a leisurely breakfast, then made our way to Osaka station. Today we are going to Kyoto and we decided to take the Shinkansen there.

We made our way to Shin Osaka and there was a few minutes wait for the next train but it was worth it as the journey only takes a few minutes (compared to the local train which can take an hour). We chanced it and didn&#8217;t reserve any seats and it was okay.

At Kyoto station we discovered there are huge queues for most of the buses. Fortunately there was a bus every 10 minutes so we did not have to wait long.
