Otani Sobyo Mausoleum (大谷祖廟) is the grave of Shinran, the founder of the Shinshu sect Otani school (Higashi Hongan-ji Temple).

From Yasaka, we wanted to visit the Chion-in temple, but managed to get lost and wandered into Otani Sobyo Hondo – a mausoleum. From here we wandered up a curvy street and were just about to give up when we stumbled almost by accident into this place.
