Today we woke up and headed down for breakfast. It’s an exciting day because we are visiting Universal Studios Japan (USJ).

Universal Studios Japan (ユニバーサル・スタジオ・ジャパン), is one of six Universal Studios theme parks, and is similar to the Universal Orlando Resort.

The Ritz Carlton has an amazing breakfast selection, including not just Japanese and Western selections but Chinese (braised belly pork and greens) and Italian (a porcini and chilli pasta). In addition there is a full salad and cold meat section, and a dazzling array of French pastries. It was so tempting to try everything, and I nearly burst my stomach making an attempt. In addition, there is a made to order counter serving eggs including omelette with truffles and everything else and crispy bacon cooked on the spot.

After a super heavy meal we were glad the toilet seat was a super advanced model that included self cleansing and deodorising functions.

## Journey to USJ

We boarded the JR Loop line and discovered it actually goes all the way to Universal City where the theme park is. We know we are on the right train because there was a girl dressed up in full Hogwarts uniform on board. I noted she is a Slytherin and hope she won’t cast a spell on me.
